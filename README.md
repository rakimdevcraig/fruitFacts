Fruitfacts

This app allows the user to pick a fruit and have some simple information about the fruit be displayed along with a picture of that fruit.

demo:

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node

The Html was used to create a dropdown menu of fruit choice and a button to submit you choice. The css was used to display a fabulous tropical background and to add a bit of color to the page. Javascript was used to send the request to the server and also print out all of the fruit properties to the DOM. Node was used as a simple localhost and to make all of m fruits objects with properties.

Optimizations
I would like to add more fruits at a later time and more facts about fruits also. This will allow people to know more information and if they're looking to treat a specific condition be able to find which fruit does that.

Lessons Learned:
In my pokemon app I didn't figure out how to add images when the information was printed to the DOM I also didn't know how to write numbers inside of an object yet. I feel like this App really strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming and will be one that I look back on to say that was when things started to really click for me.

Examples:
